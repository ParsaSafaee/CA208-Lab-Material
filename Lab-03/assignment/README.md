# Lab 03 Assignments

## Grading Sources
---
* Design asynchronous d-type flip-flop (*async_dflop.vhd*).

* Design asynchronous toggle flip-flop (*async_tflop.vhd*).

* Design 4-bit ripple counter using t-flops (*ripple_coubter.vhd*).

* Write testbench file for ripple counter that counts from 0 to 7, then resets to 0 and counts for ever again (*tb_ripple_adder.vhd*).
---
* Design mealy state machine that detects 1101 sequence (*mealy_1101_detector.vhd*).

* Design moore state machine that detects 1101 sequence (*moore_1101_detector.vhd*).

* Write testbench file for mealy and moore 1101 sequence detector (single test file), input data after reset is **`00011001010111011`** (*t_mealy_moore_1101_detector.vhd*).
---
* Design state machine that detects 0110 and 0101 (overlapped) sequences (*sequence_0110_0101_detector.vhd*).

* Write testbench file for overlapped 0110 and 1010 sequences detector, input data after reset is **`00010101110110101`** (*t_mealy_moore_1101_detector.vhd*).
